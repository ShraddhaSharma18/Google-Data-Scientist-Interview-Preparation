# Google-Data-Scientist-Interview-Preparation

I am preparing this repository to track my progress on my preparation for google data scientist interview.

1. Explain the concept of gradient descent and its role in optimizing machine learning models.
A. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function of a model. It iteratively adjusts the modelâ€™s parameters by calculating the gradient of the loss function and updating the parameters in the direction of the steepest descent.
